# Task description

As a contribution to autogen, can I create a new autogen package for a copilot extension agent that I built on autogen?


# Possibly useful insight

When somebody builds something on autogen and wants to contribute it to autogen, instead of creating a new autogen package, it's better for them to implement it in a separate github repo, then just add the autogen-extension topic to that repo. That way their contribution will be automatically discoverable through autogen's page on community extensions:  https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/extensions-user-guide/index.html
