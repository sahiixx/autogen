# Task description

As a contribution to autogen, can I create a new autogen package for a copilot extension agent that I built on autogen?


# Text that may contain an answer

1. **Understanding the User Message:**
   The user is inquiring about the possibility of creating a new package for the `autogen` framework, specifically for a "copilot extension agent" that they have developed. This indicates that the user has developed an extension or module utilizing `autogen` and wants to know if they can contribute this as a package to the `autogen` ecosystem.

2. **Possible Responses:**
   a. Yes, you can create and contribute a new package to the `autogen` framework. Here's how you can do it.
   b. No, currently `autogen` does not accept community contributions for new packages.
   c. Contact the maintainers of `autogen` for more specific guidance on contributing new packages.
   d. Provide the user with a general process for contributing to open-source projects, which may include documentation, guidelines, and points of contact for contributions.

3. **Pros and Cons of Each Response:**
   a. **Pros:** Encourages community involvement and can lead to a richer ecosystem. Provides a positive and actionable response. **Cons:** Assumes the open-source nature and plugin capability of `autogen`, which may not be accurate without further information.
   b. **Pros:** Provides a clear and definitive answer if true. **Cons:** Potentially discouraging for the user if not accurate, and lacks constructive guidance.
   c. **Pros:** Directs the user to the source of authoritative information, ensuring they get the correct guidance. **Cons:** Requires additional effort from the user to seek out and contact maintainers.
   d. **Pros:** Offers a general framework that could be applicable to many projects, encourages good practices. **Cons:** Generic advice may not address specific requirements or processes of `autogen`.

4. **Critique of the Pros and Cons:**
   - The assumption in response a might not hold if information about `autogen`'s contribution policy is not known. However, it remains a highly constructive approach.
   - Response b is only useful if factually correct, but without definite knowledge, it could mislead.
   - Response c effectively puts the onus of action on the user but ensures they get accurate and relevant information.
   - Response d is practical but might not provide the specificities needed for `autogen`.

5. **Decision on Best Response:**
   - The best response would likely be a combination of a and c, assuming the open-source nature of `autogen` and suggesting the user verify this with maintainers.

6. **Final Response:**
   Yes, you can potentially create and contribute a new package to the `autogen` framework. It's a great way to enhance the ecosystem of tools. To ensure you're following the correct process and guidelines, I recommend contacting the maintainers of `autogen` for specific instructions regarding contributions.
