Your job is to extract a possible answer to the following question from the given text.
- First review the following task.
- Then review the text that follows, which may an answer, plus reasoning that led to the answer.
- Do not attempt to actually solve the task yourself.
- Don't try to judge whether the reasoning steps were correct.
- Simply respond by summarizing the answer described in the text, omitting any other parts of the text.
- If no answer is present can be extracted from the text, simply reply "None".


# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


# Text that may contain an answer

### Step 1: Understanding the User Message

The user presents a classic logic puzzle often referred to as the "liars puzzle." The scenario involves ten people, and the task is to determine how many of them are liars based on their collective statement. Each person says, "At least one of us is not a liar." Additionally, it's a known fact that at least one of them is indeed a liar.

Key points to consider:
- Each of the ten individuals claims that "at least one of us is not a liar."
- It is known that at least one of these individuals is a liar.

### Step 2: Possible Responses

1. Interpret the statement logically and conclude how many liars there must be.
2. Break down the statement to see if it could be true, given the known fact, and deduce accordingly.
3. Consider the implications of everyone being a liar and whether that would still satisfy the known conditions.
4. Discuss any assumptions that might affect the solution.

### Step 3: Pros and Cons of Each Possible Response

1. **Interpret the statement logically:**
   - **Pros:** Directly engages with the logical implications of the statement.
   - **Cons:** May assume prior knowledge of similar logical puzzles without explanation.

2. **Break down the statement given the facts:**
   - **Pros:** Provides a clear step-by-step analysis of how the statement interacts with the known fact.
   - **Cons:** Might get complex if over-explained, potentially confusing the main point.

3. **Consider implications if all are liars:**
   - **Pros:** Quickly highlights a scenario that resolves the paradox.
   - **Cons:** Might not fully address intermediate possibilities.

4. **Discuss assumptions:**
   - **Pros:** Clarifies any hidden assumptions that could alter the interpretation of the statements.
   - **Cons:** Might overcomplicate the issue without adding clarity.

### Step 4: Critique the Pros and Cons

- The strongest approach seems to involve a logical interpretation of the statement combined with breaking down the logical implications of the given facts. Considering all being liars provides a rapid conclusion but might bypass intermediate reasoning.
- Discussing assumptions is helpful but unnecessary if the logic is straightforward and based purely on evaluating the truthfulness of the given statement.

### Step 5: Decide on the Best Response

The best approach is to break down the logical implications of the statement "At least one of us is not a liar" in conjunction with the known fact that there is at least one liar. This leads us straightforwardly to the conclusion.

### Final Response

Each person says, "At least one of us is not a liar." If this statement were true, there would be at least one person who is truthful, contradicting the known fact that there is at least one liar. Therefore, the statement must be false, meaning that all of them must be liars. Hence, all ten people are liars.
