# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


# Text that may contain an answer

### Step 1: Understanding the User Message

The user has presented a classic liar puzzle. The scenario involves ten people who are asked how many of them are liars. They all respond with the statement, "At least one of us is not a liar." The user knows for certain that at least one of these ten people is indeed a liar.

The puzzle poses the question of determining the total number of liars among the group based on the given responses and the known fact.

### Step 2: List of Possible Responses

1. **Response A**: All ten people are liars.
2. **Response B**: Nine people are liars, and one is telling the truth.
3. **Response C**: There is some other combination of liars and truth-tellers besides A and B.

### Step 3: Weigh the Pros and Cons

- **Response A: All ten people are liars.**
  - *Pros*: If all ten are liars, the given statement "At least one of us is not a liar" is false because none of them are truth-tellers, aligning with the known fact that at least one is a liar.
  - *Cons*: None apparent as it fits both the statement and the known fact perfectly.

- **Response B: Nine people are liars, and one is telling the truth.**
  - *Pros*: This scenario allows for a truth-teller who could truthfully say, "At least one of us is not a liar."
  - *Cons*: If there is one truth-teller, the statement "At least one of us is not a liar" becomes true, which contradicts the intention of the puzzle where the statement needs to be false for the majority (all liars). Additionally, since one of them is a truth-teller, they would say, "At least one of us (myself) is not a liar," but others should have said different things.

- **Response C: Some other combination.**
  - *Pros*: Flexibility to consider other combinations of liars and truth-tellers.
  - *Cons*: Any combination other than all liars will make the statement true, which contradicts the intended puzzle's logic and the fact that at least one person is a liar.

### Step 4: Critique the Pros and Cons

Upon reviewing the pros and cons, Response A holds the most weight logically. If all ten are liars, their statement "At least one of us is not a liar" would indeed be false, which aligns with the requirement that the statement must be false and the condition that at least one person must be lying.

Response B's flaw is that it allows for a truth-teller to exist, making the collective statement potentially true, contradicting the premise that "At least one of them is a liar" implies all should be lying.

Response C is too vague and does not provide a plausible solution given the constraints of the puzzle.

### Step 5: Decide on the Best Response

The best response is Response A: All ten people are liars.

### Step 6: Final Response

All ten of them are liars. Therefore, the statement "At least one of us is not a liar" is false, which is consistent with the known fact that there is at least one liar among them.
