<span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  SYSTEM  >>>>></span>

You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

We have been given a task description. Our job is not to complete the task, but merely rephrase the task in simpler, more general terms, if possible. Please reach through the following task description, then explain your understanding of the task in detail, as a single, flat list of all the important points.


# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT  >>>>></span>

To rephrase and simplify the task description and identify the main points:

1. You are asking a group of ten people a question.
2. The question you ask is: "How many of you are liars?"
3. Each of the ten people responds with the same answer: "At least one of us is not a liar."
4. You have prior knowledge that at least one person in the group is definitely a liar.
5. Your task is to determine the total number of liars in the group.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

Do you see any parts of this list that are irrelevant to actually solving the task? If so, explain which items are irrelevant.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT RESPONSE  >>>>></span>

Upon analyzing the list, the following points are not strictly necessary for solving the task:

1. **The specific question asked**: "How many of you are liars?" is not directly relevant to solving the task, as the critical part is their identical response and your prior knowledge. The focus should be on their response and the information given.

2. **The fact that each person gives the same response**: While it helps paint the scenario, the specific detail that everyone says the same thing doesn't change the logic needed to solve the problem.

The relevant points essential for solving the task are:

- The group consists of ten people.
- All of them assert that "At least one of us is not a liar."
- You know for certain that at least one person in the group is a liar.
- You need to find out how many people in the group are liars.
