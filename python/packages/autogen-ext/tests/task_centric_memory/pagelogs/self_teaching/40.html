You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

We have been given a task description. Our job is not to complete the task, but merely rephrase the task in simpler, more general terms, if possible. Please reach through the following task description, then explain your understanding of the task in detail, as a single, flat list of all the important points.


# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT  >>>>></span>

Here is a simplified breakdown of the task:

1. You are asking a group of ten people a question.
2. The question you ask is: "How many of you are liars?"
3. Each person in the group gives the same answer: "At least one of us is not a liar."
4. You already know for sure that at least one person in the group is lying.
5. Your task is to determine how many people in the group are liars.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

Do you see any parts of this list that are irrelevant to actually solving the task? If so, explain which items are irrelevant.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT  >>>>></span>

Yes, some parts of the list are not directly relevant to solving the task:

1. **The specific question asked to the group: "How many of you are liars?"** - This detail is not needed to solve the task. The critical part is their response and what it implies, not the exact wording of the question.

2. **Each person gives the same answer: "At least one of us is not a liar."** - While this is important for understanding their collective response, the exact phrasing is less relevant than understanding the implication of their answer.

The essential information needed to solve the task is:

- There are ten people in the group.
- They all claim that at least one person is not a liar.
- You know for sure that at least one person is lying.
- Determine the total number of liars in the group based on these statements.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

Revise your original list to include only the most general terms, those that are critical to solving the task, removing any themes or descriptions that are not essential to the solution. Your final list may be shorter, but do not leave out any part of the task that is needed for solving the task. Do not add any additional commentary either before or after the list.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT RESPONSE  >>>>></span>

1. There are ten people.
2. They all say at least one person is not a liar.
3. You know at least one person is lying.
4. Determine how many are liars.
