ENTER MemoryController._test_for_failure

Task description, including any insights:  You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?

## Important insights that may help solve tasks like this
- When dealing with liar puzzles, remember that liars always make false statements; thus, if a group's claim seems true, it's likely false, indicating all are liars. Always question the truth value of collective statements to reveal the underlying logic.


Expected answer:  All of them are liars.
