# Task description

You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?


# Text that may contain an answer

To solve this problem, I will follow a structured approach to understand the situation and determine the number of vampires in the village.

1. **Understanding the Situation**: 
   - You are Van Helsing, tasked with identifying vampires in the village of Șirnea. 
   - You have observed a vampire, confirming that at least one vampire exists in the village.
   - There are 100 residents in the village.
   - Humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie.
   - Each resident responded to your question, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?", by saying, "At least one of us is a human."

2. **Possible Responses**:
   - All residents are vampires.
   - Only one resident is human, and the rest are vampires.
   - More than one but less than 100 residents are humans.

3. **Weighing the Pros and Cons**:
   - **All residents are vampires**:
     - **Pros**: If all residents are vampires, they would lie and say that there is at least one human, which matches the response you received.
     - **Cons**: This scenario is consistent with the response.
     
   - **Only one resident is human, and the rest are vampires**:
     - **Pros**: The single human would truthfully say there is at least one human, and the vampires would lie and say the same.
     - **Cons**: This scenario is also consistent with the response.

   - **More than one but less than 100 residents are humans**:
     - **Pros**: Multiple humans would truthfully say there is at least one human.
     - **Cons**: This implies the presence of multiple vampires who would also lie and say the same. However, this scenario doesn't fit because if there were multiple humans, they would all independently confirm the presence of humans, meaning the statement would be redundant.

4. **Critiquing the Pros and Cons**:
   - The response "At least one of us is a human" aligns perfectly with both scenarios where there is only one or no human resident.
   - If there were multiple humans, the statement would not be as collectively uniform, as each human would potentially provide the actual number of humans rather than the generic statement.

5. **Deciding on the Best Response**:
   - The simplest explanation is often correct. Given how liars work in logic puzzles, all residents saying "At least one of us is a human" implies they are all lying since the statement can be true if only one or no humans exist.
   - Hence, the response from the village where everyone claims there is at least one human indicates they are all lying.

6. **Final Response**:
   - All 100 residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires.
