You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

We have been given a task description. Our job is not to complete the task, but merely rephrase the task in simpler, more general terms, if possible. Please reach through the following task description, then explain your understanding of the task in detail, as a single, flat list of all the important points.


# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT RESPONSE  >>>>></span>

To rephrase and simplify the task description and identify the main points:

1. You are asking a group of ten people a question.
2. The question you ask is: "How many of you are liars?"
3. Each of the ten people responds with the same answer: "At least one of us is not a liar."
4. You have prior knowledge that at least one person in the group is definitely a liar.
5. Your task is to determine the total number of liars in the group.
