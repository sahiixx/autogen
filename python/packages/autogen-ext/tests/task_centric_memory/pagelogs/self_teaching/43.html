You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

We have been given a potential insight that may or may not be useful for solving a given task.
- First review the following task.
- Then review the insight that follows, and consider whether it might help solve the given task.
- Do not attempt to actually solve the task.
- Reply with a single character, '1' if the insight may be useful, or '0' if it is not.


# Task description

You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?


# Possibly useful insight

When dealing with liar puzzles, remember that liars always make false statements; thus, if a group's claim seems true, it's likely false, indicating all are liars. Always question the truth value of collective statements to reveal the underlying logic.
