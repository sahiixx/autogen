GIVEN TASK:
You ask ten people 'How many of you are liars?' They all answer 'At least one of us is not a liar.' You happen to know that at least one of them IS a liar. How many of them are liars in total?

<a href="27.html">27  Ask the model to rephrase the task in a list of important points</a>

<a href="28.html">28  Ask the model to identify irrelevant points</a>

<a href="29.html">29  Ask the model to make a final list of general terms</a>

GIVEN INSIGHT:
When dealing with liar puzzles, remember that liars always make false statements; thus, if a group's claim seems true, it's likely false, indicating all are liars. Always question the truth value of collective statements to reveal the underlying logic.
