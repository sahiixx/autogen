- My job is to create a thorough index for a book called Task Completion, and I need your help.
- Every paragraph in the book needs to be indexed by all the topics related to various kinds of tasks and strategies for completing them.
- Your job is to read the text below and extract the task-completion topics that are covered.
- The number of topics depends on the length and content of the text. But you should list at least one topic, and potentially many more.
- Each topic you list should be a meaningful phrase composed of a few words. Don't use whole sentences as topics.
- Don't include details that are unrelated to the general nature of the task, or a potential strategy for completing tasks.
- List each topic on a separate line, without any extra text like numbering, or bullets, or any other formatting, because we don't want those things in the index of the book.

# Text to be indexed

1. There are ten people.
2. They all say at least one person is not a liar.
3. You know at least one person is lying.
4. Determine how many are liars.
