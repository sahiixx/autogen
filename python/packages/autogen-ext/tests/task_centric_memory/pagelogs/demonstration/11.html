ENTER Apprentice._assign_task_to_assistant_agent
You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 16, 17, 19, 11, 9, 10, 2, 5, 4. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.

-----  RESPONSE  -----

1. **Understanding the User Message:**
   - You need to determine the minimum number of cell phone towers required to cover all houses located at specific mile markers.
   - Each tower covers a 4-mile radius, meaning it can cover any house located within 4 miles in either direction.
   - The mile markers where the houses are located are: 16, 17, 19, 11, 9, 10, 2, 5, 4.

2. **Possible Responses:**
   - Calculate the optimal placement of towers to cover all houses with a minimal number of towers.

3. **Weighing the Pros and Cons:**
   - **Calculate Optimal Placement:**
     - **Pros:** Provides a clear and accurate solution to cover all houses with the fewest towers.
     - **Cons:** Requires careful consideration of overlapping coverage areas.

4. **Critique the Pros and Cons:**
   - The only viable approach is to calculate the optimal placement as it directly addresses the problem without unnecessary steps.

5. **Decide on the Best Response:**
   - Calculating the optimal placement is indeed the best approach.

6. **Final Response:**
   - To cover all houses, place towers at the following mile markers:
     - One tower at mile 3 (covers houses at 2, 4, 5).
     - Another tower at mile 13 (covers houses at 9, 10, 11).
     - Another tower at mile 17 (covers houses at 16, 17, 19).
   - Thus, the minimum number of towers needed is 3.
