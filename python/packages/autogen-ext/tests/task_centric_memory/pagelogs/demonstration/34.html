You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.
In responding to every user message, you follow the same multi-step process given here:
1. Explain your understanding of the user message in detail, covering all the important points.
2. List as many possible responses as you can think of.
3. Carefully list and weigh the pros and cons (if any) of each possible response.
4. Critique the pros and cons above, looking for any flaws in your reasoning. But don't make up flaws that don't exist.
5. Decide on the best response, looping back to step 1 if none of the responses are satisfactory.
6. Finish by providing your final response in the particular format requested by the user.

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 16, 17, 19, 11, 9, 10, 2, 5, 4. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.

## Important insights that may help solve tasks like this
- Example task:

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 17, 20, 19, 10, 11, 12, 3, 6. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.

Example solution:

Sort the houses by location:  3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20. Then start at one end and place the towers only where absolutely needed. The house at 3 could be served by a tower as far away as mile marker 7, because 3 + 4 = 7, so place a tower at 7. This obviously covers houses up to mile 7. But a coverage radius of 4 miles (in each direction) means a total coverage of 8 miles. So the tower at mile 7 would reach all the way to mile 11, covering the houses at 10 and 11. The next uncovered house would be at mile 12 (not 10), requiring a second tower. It could go at mile 16 (which is 12 + 4) and this tower would reach up to mile 20 (16 + 4), covering the remaining houses. So 2 towers would be enough.

**Understanding of the User Message:**

The user is asking to determine the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses located along a road, given specific mile markers for each house. Each tower has a coverage radius of 4 miles. The user also provided a similar example with a solution, which involves sorting the house locations, determining the optimal placement of cell phone towers, and ensuring all houses are within the coverage radius of at least one tower.

**Possible Responses:**

1. **Apply the algorithm from the example to the given problem:**
   - Sort the house locations.
   - Start placing towers where absolutely needed, considering the 4-mile radius.
   
2. **Explain the step-by-step process for solving the given problem using a detailed breakdown.**

3. **Provide a numerical integer value as the final answer without explanation.**

4. **Explain why the given problem and example are similar and then solve the problem.**

**Pros and Cons of Each Response:**

1. **Apply the algorithm from the example to the given problem:**
   - Pros: Directly applies the method explained in the example, ensuring clarity and relevance.
   - Cons: Might not provide enough explanation for users unfamiliar with the approach.

2. **Explain the step-by-step process for solving the given problem using a detailed breakdown:**
   - Pros: Provides clarity and understanding of the problem-solving process.
   - Cons: May be too verbose if the user only wants the final answer.

3. **Provide a numerical integer value as the final answer without explanation:**
   - Pros: Quick and straight to the point, for users who want immediate results.
   - Cons: Lacks educational value and might not be satisfying for users looking to understand the solution.

4. **Explain why the given problem and example are similar and then solve the problem:**
   - Pros: Shows a connection between similar problems, enhancing understanding.
   - Cons: Could be redundant if the user already understands the similarity.

**Critique of the Pros and Cons:**

Each response has its merits depending on the user's needs. However, since the user has provided a detailed example, it might be beneficial to walk through the steps to demonstrate understanding while delivering the answer concisely. This ensures that all users, whether looking for a quick answer or a detailed explanation, are satisfied.

**Decide on the Best Response:**

Considering the balance between clarity and conciseness, a response that explains the process briefly and then provides the answer seems most appropriate.

**Final Response:**

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the house locations**: 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19.
2. **Place towers strategically**:
   - Cover the house at mile 2 with a tower at mile 6 (2 + 4 = 6), covering up to mile 10.
   - The next uncovered house is at mile 11. Place another tower at mile 15 (11 + 4 = 15), covering up to mile 19.

With these placements, all houses are covered. Thus, the minimum number of cell phone towers needed is **2**.
