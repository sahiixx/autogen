# Task description

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 16, 17, 19, 11, 9, 10, 2, 5, 4. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.


# Text that may contain an answer

**Understanding of the User Message:**

The user is asking to determine the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses located along a road, given specific mile markers for each house. Each tower has a coverage radius of 4 miles. The user also provided a similar example with a solution, which involves sorting the house locations, determining the optimal placement of cell phone towers, and ensuring all houses are within the coverage radius of at least one tower.

**Possible Responses:**

1. **Apply the algorithm from the example to the given problem:**
   - Sort the house locations.
   - Start placing towers where absolutely needed, considering the 4-mile radius.
   
2. **Explain the step-by-step process for solving the given problem using a detailed breakdown.**

3. **Provide a numerical integer value as the final answer without explanation.**

4. **Explain why the given problem and example are similar and then solve the problem.**

**Pros and Cons of Each Response:**

1. **Apply the algorithm from the example to the given problem:**
   - Pros: Directly applies the method explained in the example, ensuring clarity and relevance.
   - Cons: Might not provide enough explanation for users unfamiliar with the approach.

2. **Explain the step-by-step process for solving the given problem using a detailed breakdown:**
   - Pros: Provides clarity and understanding of the problem-solving process.
   - Cons: May be too verbose if the user only wants the final answer.

3. **Provide a numerical integer value as the final answer without explanation:**
   - Pros: Quick and straight to the point, for users who want immediate results.
   - Cons: Lacks educational value and might not be satisfying for users looking to understand the solution.

4. **Explain why the given problem and example are similar and then solve the problem:**
   - Pros: Shows a connection between similar problems, enhancing understanding.
   - Cons: Could be redundant if the user already understands the similarity.

**Critique of the Pros and Cons:**

Each response has its merits depending on the user's needs. However, since the user has provided a detailed example, it might be beneficial to walk through the steps to demonstrate understanding while delivering the answer concisely. This ensures that all users, whether looking for a quick answer or a detailed explanation, are satisfied.

**Decide on the Best Response:**

Considering the balance between clarity and conciseness, a response that explains the process briefly and then provides the answer seems most appropriate.

**Final Response:**

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the house locations**: 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19.
2. **Place towers strategically**:
   - Cover the house at mile 2 with a tower at mile 6 (2 + 4 = 6), covering up to mile 10.
   - The next uncovered house is at mile 11. Place another tower at mile 15 (11 + 4 = 15), covering up to mile 19.

With these placements, all houses are covered. Thus, the minimum number of cell phone towers needed is **2**.
