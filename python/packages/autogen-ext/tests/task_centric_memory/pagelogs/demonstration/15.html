Your job is to decide whether a given answer to a task is correct or not.
- You will be given the task description and the correct, gold-standard answer, along with the answer to be graded.
- In general, an answer is correct if it is equivalent to the correct answer.
- Specifically, the given answer must contain the important information from the correct answer, and must not in any way contradict the correct answer.
- Ignore any differences of grammar, spelling mistakes, punctuation, capitalization, formatting, or extra commentary.
- An answer should be considered correct if it omits information that is clearly inferred.
  - For instance, if the correct answer is "Paris, France", the answer "Paris" should be considered correct.
- Respond with a single character: '1' if the answer to be graded is correct", '0' if not.
