You are a helpful and thoughtful assistant.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

We have been given a task description. Our job is not to complete the task, but merely rephrase the task in simpler, more general terms, if possible. Please reach through the following task description, then explain your understanding of the task in detail, as a single, flat list of all the important points.


# Task description

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 16, 17, 19, 11, 9, 10, 2, 5, 4. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT  >>>>></span>

Here's a simplified breakdown of the task description:

1. **Role**: You are acting as a telecommunications engineer.
2. **Objective**: Determine how many cell phone towers are needed.
3. **Location**: The task involves a specific stretch of road.
4. **House Locations**: Houses are positioned at the following mile markers: 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 19.
5. **Coverage Requirement**: Each cell phone tower can cover an area within a 4-mile radius.
6. **Task Goal**: Calculate the minimum number of towers required to cover all the houses mentioned.
7. **Output**: Provide a single positive integer as the answer.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

Do you see any parts of this list that are irrelevant to actually solving the task? If so, explain which items are irrelevant.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT  >>>>></span>

In the context of solving the task, some elements of the list may not be directly relevant to finding the solution:

1. **Role**: Knowing that you are acting as a "telecommunications engineer" is not necessary for solving the problem. The focus should be on determining the number of towers, regardless of the role.

2. **Location**: The specific mention of a "stretch of road" is not critically relevant as long as you know where the houses are located and their mile markers.

The core elements needed to solve the task are the **house locations**, **coverage requirement**, and the **goal** of determining the minimum number of towers. The output requirement is also relevant to ensure you present the solution in the correct form.


<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  USER  >>>>></span>

Revise your original list to include only the most general terms, those that are critical to solving the task, removing any themes or descriptions that are not essential to the solution. Your final list may be shorter, but do not leave out any part of the task that is needed for solving the task. Do not add any additional commentary either before or after the list.


<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"><<<<<  ASSISTANT RESPONSE  >>>>></span>

1. House locations: mile markers 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19.
2. Coverage: each tower covers a 4-mile radius.
3. Goal: find the minimum number of towers to cover all houses.
4. Output: a single positive integer.
