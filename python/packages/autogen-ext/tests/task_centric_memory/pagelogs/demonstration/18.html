- My job is to create a thorough index for a book called Task Completion, and I need your help.
- Every paragraph in the book needs to be indexed by all the topics related to various kinds of tasks and strategies for completing them.
- Your job is to read the text below and extract the task-completion topics that are covered.
- The number of topics depends on the length and content of the text. But you should list at least one topic, and potentially many more.
- Each topic you list should be a meaningful phrase composed of a few words. Don't use whole sentences as topics.
- Don't include details that are unrelated to the general nature of the task, or a potential strategy for completing tasks.
- List each topic on a separate line, without any extra text like numbering, or bullets, or any other formatting, because we don't want those things in the index of the book.

# Text to be indexed

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 17, 20, 19, 10, 11, 12, 3, 6. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.
