1 POTENTIALLY RELEVANT MEMOS

  TASK: You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 17, 20, 19, 10, 11, 12, 3, 6. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.

  INSIGHT: Example task:

You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. Houses are located at mile markers 17, 20, 19, 10, 11, 12, 3, 6. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.

Example solution:

Sort the houses by location:  3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20. Then start at one end and place the towers only where absolutely needed. The house at 3 could be served by a tower as far away as mile marker 7, because 3 + 4 = 7, so place a tower at 7. This obviously covers houses up to mile 7. But a coverage radius of 4 miles (in each direction) means a total coverage of 8 miles. So the tower at mile 7 would reach all the way to mile 11, covering the houses at 10 and 11. The next uncovered house would be at mile 12 (not 10), requiring a second tower. It could go at mile 16 (which is 12 + 4) and this tower would reach up to mile 20 (16 + 4), covering the remaining houses. So 2 towers would be enough.
